A Accident Prediction using Machine Learning 
• Preprocessed accident dataset (traffic, weather, time factors) using pandas, regex, and seaborn for visualization. 
• Engineered features like weather condition, day/night, and accident hour; handled missing values with imputation. 
• Trained RandomForest model with scaled inputs; performed train-test split and hyperparameter tuning. 
• Evaluated performance with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix; saved model with joblib. 
• Built an interactive Streamlit app to predict accident severity in real time.
